      <description>This notebook is dedicated to a short visual exploration of a survey data. The survey participants are students in a graduate program. The survey includes 13 questions related to data science skills and experiences, as well as some personal questions to get to know your class better. As part of the survey, each student answered 13 questions and also predicted how the fellow students would answer each question. For example, there is a question around food preferences and whether one prefers spicy, sweet or savory food.</description>

      <description>1. Visualization technique description
The visualization technique that I am going to demonstrate in this notebook is network visualization.
First, I wanted to cover a couple of concepts that I am using in this notebook. Network comprises of edges and nodes. Nodes are separate entities, for example, people in a social network. Edges are the connection points between the nodes, for example, relationship between people in a social network. Visual representation of edges and nodes is a network visualization.</description>

Telecom industry is highly saturated when it comes to new customer acquisition. Everyone has a phone or two and there is not much room left for growth of market share for the telecom providers. To grow the market share telecom providers either a) need to convince people they need even more connected devices per household or b) win market share from the competitors. Wining competitorsâ€™ market share is important; however, telecom companies also need to make sure that they keep their base or current customers satisfied with the service and reduce churn among their customer base.</description>

Objectives:
(1) Develop regression model in R to establish and evaluate relationship between happiness score and various socioeconomic, demographic, and health indicators;
(2) identify variables that are the most impactful in predicting the happiness score.
Happiness score is published annually in the World Happiness Report by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. Happiness score is calculated based on respondents estimate of their own lives. Each country has a sample size of 2000 to 3000 respondents that complete a comprehensive survey about their lives that feeds into the total happiness score.</description>

(I)	Introduction
Supply chain specialists are often tasked with minimizing cost while maintaining acceptable service levels. Inventory carrying cost directly impacts profitability. If a business carries too little inventory, there will be shortages that lead to missed business opportunities, but if a business carries too much inventory, it can become obsolete and inventory carrying costs will increase.
The airline industry is no exception. They must minimize inventory carrying cost while ensuring that inventory is positioned in the correct locations at the appropriate time.</description>
